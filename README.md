## About

Tic-Tac-Toe project from [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) with history of moves.

As a flex, I wanted to build the project before going through the tutorial. To my surprise, I kind of struggled, revised some fundamentals, mostly on immutability of state and React's strict mode.

## Running the project locally

- Clone the project.
- Install the dependencies `pnpm install`.
- Run locally `pnpm dev`.
